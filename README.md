# MiraclePlus Project Directory (Cohort 2025)

This repository acts as a **public directory and entry point** — highlighting what different teams have actually built, explored, or validated with real compute resources.

---

## Why this directory exists

Many teams ask the same question before applying for compute:

> *“Is my project suitable for this kind of support?”*

This directory exists to answer that question **with real examples**.

Here, you can see:

* What kinds of projects have been supported
* What directions they explored with compute
* How teams chose to structure their work and share results

---

## What kinds of projects are included

The current directory includes **67 projects**, spanning:

* **Embodied AI & Robotics**
  Navigation, manipulation, humanoid robotics, physical interaction

* **Agents & Intelligent Systems**
  GUI agents, system-level agents, long-horizon reasoning, agent frameworks

* **Multimodal & Generative AI**
  Image, video, audio, 3D content generation

* **AI for Science**
  Drug discovery, materials, scientific computing, mathematics

* **Systems & Inference Infrastructure**
  Inference acceleration, model serving, efficiency and hardware–software co-design

* **Simulation, World Models & Physical AI**
  Simulation platforms, world models, physical training environments

Each project entry links to **external repositories, demos, or documentation** maintained by the project team.

---

## How these teams used compute

Across the directory, compute resources have been used for:

* Training and fine-tuning large models
* Evaluating inference efficiency and system performance
* Exploring multimodal and agent-based workflows
* Running large-scale scientific or simulation experiments

The entries reflect **work that has already happened**, not proposals or ideas.

---

## Thinking about applying for compute

If you are working on a project in any of the directions above,
this directory can help you answer:

* *Has something similar been supported before?*
* *What level of work or exploration is realistic with compute support?*
* *How do teams usually share their results?*
